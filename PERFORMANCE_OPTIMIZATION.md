# Performance Optimization Plan for BeatSync

## Current Issues Identified:
1. Large bundle size with many dependencies
2. Heavy animation libraries
3. No code splitting
4. Large audio files in public directory
5. No compression or caching strategies
6. Heavy Radix UI components

## Optimization Strategy:

### 1. Bundle Size Reduction
- Replace motion with lighter alternatives
- Code split components
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Remove unused dependencies

### 2. Audio Optimization
- Implement audio compression
- Use Web Workers for audio processing
- Streaming audio instead of full file loads
- Audio format optimization

### 3. Network Optimization
- Enable compression
- Implement service worker for caching
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Image optimization

### 4. Mobile Performance
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Reduced animations on mobile
- Simplified mobile UI
- Better responsive design

### 5. Low Network Speed Support
- Progressive loading
- Offline support
- Connection-aware features
- Bandwidth detection

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations:
- Bundle size: Unknown (likely 600kB+)
- No code splitting
- No network awareness
- Heavy motion animations on all connections

### After Optimizations:
- **Shared vendors**: 426kB (optimized and chunked)
- **Main route**: 441kB first load (includes all optimizations)
- **Dynamic route**: 466kB (room functionality)
- **Code splitting**: 3 main chunks (vendors, UI, motion)

## 🚀 Low Internet Speed Optimizations

### 1. **Automatic Quality Reduction**
```typescript
// Audio quality adapts automatically
isSlowConnection ? 'low' : 'medium' // 22kHz vs 44kHz
```

### 2. **Conditional Feature Loading**
```typescript
// Heavy components only load on fast connections
enablePreloading: !isSlowConnection && !saveData
```

### 3. **Smart Caching Strategy**
- **Cache First**: Static assets, CSS, JS
- **Network First**: API calls
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Images
- **Offline Fallback**: Graceful degradation

### 4. **Data Saver Mode Support**
- Detects browser data saver settings
- Reduces image quality automatically
- Minimizes animations
- Optimizes audio compression

## üöÄ Quick Deploy

Deploy your own BeatSync instance using the included deployment script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The deployment script supports multiple platforms and provides guided setup for:
- **üåê Frontend**: Vercel/Netlify deployment
- **üîß Backend**: Railway/Render deployment  
- **üíæ Storage**: Cloudflare R2 integration

### Manual Deployment Options:
- **Frontend**: [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/yourusername/beatsync&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL)
- **Backend**: Use Railway or Render with the included configs

## Environment Variables

### Client Configuration (`apps/client/.env`)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_key_here  # Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com  # Optional: Analytics
```

### Server Configuration (`apps/server/.env`)

```env
# Spotify Web API Integration (Optional)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

# Storage Configuration (Optional)
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_cloudflare_access_key
CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_cloudflare_secret_key
CLOUDFLARE_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT=your_r2_endpoint
```

### üéµ Setting up Spotify Integration

1. Create a Spotify app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Set redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/callback` (for development)
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your server `.env` file
4. Restart the server - Spotify search will now work with real music data!

**Note**: Without Spotify credentials, the app falls back to external providers and mock data.

## Quickstart

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

Fill in the `.env` file in `apps/client` with the following:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

Run the following commands to start the server and client:

```sh
bun install          # installs once for all workspaces
bun dev              # starts both client (:3000) and server (:8080)
```
